# 🧱 Roblox Kitsch Goods

We built a **Roblox-style photo-to-avatar converter** using the
Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model (Nano Banana).  
By uploading any photo, the app transforms it into a **blocky,
low-poly Roblox-style avatar**. Options allow adding a sword, a torch,
or even a helmet. The results carry a playful **병맛감성** vibe:
funny, endearing, and almost like collectible goods.

## ✨ Features
- Upload a photo → get a Roblox-style avatar
- Add fun extras like sword, torch, or helmet
- Built with Gradio for a simple demo UI

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"
python app.py
